## Pricing FAQ

### What happens after the license expires?
You can continue using the version you licensed perpetually, but you won't receive updates, bug fixes, or support. To stay current, renew annually.

### Can I transfer licenses between employees?
Yes. Licenses are "floating seats" - you can reassign them as employees join/leave.

### Do contractors count toward the seat limit?
Yes. Any person (employee or contractor) using OMG counts as one seat.

### Can I use OMG in multiple companies I own?
Each legal entity requires a separate license. Contact us for multi-entity discounts.

## Compliance & Enforcement

### How do you verify license compliance?
- Self-reported (honor system for most customers)
- License key validation in the software
- Periodic audits for Enterprise customers (contractual right)

### What happens if I use OMG without a license?
Using OMG for commercial purposes without a license is:
- ❌ Copyright infringement
- ❌ Breach of license terms
- ❌ Subject to legal action

We reserve the right to:
- Pursue legal remedies (injunctions, damages)
- Charge backdated license fees + penalties
- Publicize violations

**Don't risk it.** Licenses are affordable and buying one is the right thing to do.

### Can I audit the source code before purchasing?
Absolutely! The source code is public on GitHub. Review it thoroughly before buying.

---

## Open Source & Community

### Why isn't OMG open source?
We believe in:
- ✅ Transparency (public source code)
- ✅ Security (auditable by anyone)
- ✅ Sustainability (commercial funding for development)

But we also believe developers deserve to be paid for their work. Source-available licensing lets us:
- Fund ongoing development
- Provide support and documentation
- Keep OMG competitive and maintained

### Can I contribute to OMG?
Yes! We accept:
- Bug reports (GitHub issues)
- Feature requests (GitHub discussions)
- Security reports (security@omg.dev - coming soon)
- Documentation improvements

Code contributions require a Contributor License Agreement (CLA) since we hold commercial licensing rights.

### Will OMG ever become open source?
Possibly. We're considering a "delayed open source" model where versions convert to MIT/Apache-2.0 after 3-5 years. This is common in the BSL (Business Source License) model.
