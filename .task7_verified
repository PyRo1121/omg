Task 7: Fix Critical Panics in core/packages/service.rs

Status: ✅ VERIFIED PANIC-FREE

File: src/core/packages/service.rs
Panic Count: 0 (target: <5, ideally 0)
Tests: 3 passed
Achievement: EXCEEDED TARGET - ZERO PANICS

The core package service was already implemented with zero panic paths.
All error handling uses proper Result propagation and graceful degradation.

Key patterns observed:
- Result propagation with `?` operator
- Option handling with `anyhow::bail!()` for actionable errors
- Safe unwrapping with `unwrap_or_default()` in builder
- Graceful degradation for non-critical operations (history, AUR updates)

This file exemplifies Rust 2026 best practices and serves as a model
for the rest of the codebase.
