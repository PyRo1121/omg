  "description": "We need to get our CI/CD to be world class and production ready and all actions pass which you can check on using gh commands. Also fix errors and stub code or features that aren't production ready so we aren't just coding slop. Use the Rust Engineer agent to help guide as a rust engineer expert spin up all the agents needed and make it world class production ready."
